/**
 * A statemachine is used to execute transitions from certain states to other
 * states, for an entity that represents a domain object, by applying guard logic 
 * to see if a transition is allowed and transition logic to process the transition.
 *
 *
 * PACKAGE PHILOSOPHY
 * This whole package strives to follow the open/closed principle, making it
 * open for extension (adding your own logic through subclassing) but closed
 * for modification. For that purpose, we provide Loader interfaces, Builders
 * and Persistence Adapters for the backend implementation. States and
 * Transitions can also be subclassed to store data and provide functionality.
 *
 * Following the same philosophy: if you want more functionality in the
 * statemachine, you can use the provided methods and override them in your
 * subclass. multiple hooks are provided. Most functionality should be provided by
 * using the diverse ways of interacting with the statemachine: callables can be injected,
 * commands can be injected, event handlers can be defined and hooks can be overriden.
 *
 * We have provided multiple persistance backends to function as a data store to store all
 * relevant information for a statemachine including configuration, transition history and current states.
 * - relational databases: postgresql, mysql, sqlite
 * - nosql key/value: redis
 * - nosql document based: mongodb 
 * Memory and session backend adapters can be used to temporarily store the state information.
 * yaml, json and xml loaders can be used to load configuration data from files containing those
 * data formats.
 * 
 * Examples are provided in the 'examples' folder and serve to highlight some of the
 * features and the way to work with the package. The unittests can serve as examples too, 
 * including interaction with databases.
 *
 *
 * ENVIRONMENTS OF USAGE:
 * - 1: a one time process:
 * -- on webpages where there are page refreshes in between (use session/pdo adapter)
 * see 'examples/session'
 * -- an api where succesive calls are made (use pdo adapter)
 * -- cron jobs (pdo adapter)
 * - 2: a longer running process:
 * -- a php daemon that runs as a background process (use memory adapter)
 * -- an interactive shell environment (use memory adapter)
 * see 'examples/interactive'
 * 
 * 
 * DESCRIPTION OF THE 4 MAIN MODELS OF USAGE:
 * - 1: DELEGATION: Use an existing domain model. You can use a subclass of the
 * AbstractFactory to get a StateMachine, since that will put the creation of
 * all the relevant Contextual classes and Transitions in a reusable model.
 * usage: This is the most formal, least invasive and powerful model of usage, but the most complex.
 * Use Rules and Commands to interact with your domain model without altering a domain model
 * to work with the statemachine.
 * see 'examples/trafficlight'
 * - 2: INHERITANCE: Subclass a statemachine. Build the full Context and all transitions in
 * the constructor of your subclass (which could be a domain model itself) and
 * call the parent constructor. use the hooks to provide functionality (optionally a ModelBuilder and callbacks).
 * usage: This is the most flexible model of usage, but mixes your domain logic with the statemachine.
 * see 'examples/inheritance'
 * - 3: COMPOSITION: Use object composition. Instantiate and build a statemachine in a domain
 * model and build the full Context, Transitions and statemachine there. Use a ModelBuilder and callbacks
 * to drive functionality.
 * usage: This is a good mixture between encapsulating statemachine logic and flexibility/formal usage. 
 * see 'examples/composition'
 * - 4: STANDALONE: Use the statemachine as is, without any domain models. Your application will use it and inspect the
 * statemachine to act on it. Use callables to provide functionality
 * usage: This is the easiest model of usage, but the least powerful.
 * see 'examples/interactive'
 *
 * MECHANISMS FOR GUARD AND TRANSITION LOGIC
 * 1. rules and commands: they are fully qualified class names of Rule and Command (sub)classes that can be injected
 *      in Transition and State instances. they accept the domain model provided via an EntityBuilder 
 *      in their constructor.
 * 2. hooks: the methods in this class that start with an underscore and can be overriden in a subclass.
 *      these can be used to provide a subclass of this machine specifically tailored to your application domain.
 *      @link http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HookMethod
 * 3. eventHandlers: methods that can be defined on the domain model. They will only be called when they
 *      are defined on the domain model and all start with 'on' prefix eg: onExitState, onTransition
 *      @link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(computing)#Event_handler
 * 4. callables: callables can be injected in Transition and State instances. callables are 
 *      user defined methods in various flavours (closure, instance methods, static methods etc.) that
 *      will be called if they are valid. This is the easiest way to start using the statemachine.
 *      @link https://php.net/manual/en/language.types.callable.php
 *      @see TransitionTest::shouldAcceptMultipleCallableTypes for all implementations
 *
 * DESCRIPTION OF FULL TRANSITION ALGORITHM (and the usage modes where they apply)
 * 1. guard: _onCheckCanTransition($transition) //hook: inheritance.
 * 2. guard: $entity->onCheckCanTransition($identifier, $transition) // event handler: delegation, composition, inheritance
 * 3. guard: $transition->can($context) // check Rule: delegation, composition, inheritance, standalone
 * 4. guard: $transition->can($context) // callable: standalone, delegation, composition, inheritance
 * !!!  If all (existing) guards return true, then the transition is allowed. return true/false to allow/disallow transition.
 * 5. logic: _onExitState($transition) //hook: inheritance
 * 6. logic: $entity->onExitState($identifier, $transition) //event handler: delegation, composition, inheritance
 * 7. logic: $state_from->exitAction($context) //execute Command: delegation, composition, inheritance, standalone
 * 8. logic: state exit: $callable($entity) // callable: standalone, delegation, composition, inheritance
 * 9. logic: _onTransition($transition) //hook: inheritance
 * 10. logic: $entity->onEvent($identifier, $transition) //event handler: delegation, composition, inheritance, only if transition was event driven
 * 11. logic: $entity->on<$event>($identifier, $transition) //event handler: delegation, composition, inheritance, only if transition was event driven
 * 12. logic: $entity->onTransition($identifier, $transition) //event handler: delegation, composition, inheritance
 * 13. logic: $transition->process($context) //execute Command: delegation, composition, inheritance, standalone
 * 14. logic: $transition->process($context) // callable: standalone, delegation, composition, inheritance
 * 15. logic: $entity->onEnterState($identifier, $transition) //event handler: delegation, composition, inheritance
 * 16. logic: $state_to->entryAction($context) //execute Command: delegation, composition, inheritance, standalone
 * 17. logic: state entry: $callable($entity) // callable: standalone, delegation, composition, inheritance
 * 18. logic: _onEnterState($transition) //hook: inheritance
 *
 * each hook can be overriden and implemented in a subclass, providing
 * functionality that is specific to your application. This allows you to use
 * the core mechanisms of the izzum package and extend it to your needs.
 *
 * each rule and command will be injected with the entity and if they implement
 * the method 'setEvent' the event will be set in case the transition was called
 * with the event.
 *
 * each event handler might be implemented on the entity/domain object and will be called, only if
 * available, with the $transition and $event arguments.
 * 
 * each callable might be set on a transition or state and comes in different forms:
 * closure, anonymouse function, instance method, static methods etc. (see php manual)
 * 
 *  Each transition will take place only if the transition logic (Rule, hooks, event handlers &
 *  callables) allows it. Each exit state, transition and entry state will then execute specific logic
 * (Command, hooks, event handlers & callables).
 *
 * for simple applications, the use of callables and event handlers is advised since it
 * is easier to setup and use with existing code.
 *
 * for more formal applications, the use of rules and commands is advised since
 * it allows for better encapsulated (and tested) business logic and more flexibility in
 * configuration via a database or config file.
 * 
 * The statemachine should be loaded with States and Transitions, which define
 * from what state to what other state transitions are allowed. The transitions
 * are checked against guard clauses (in the form of a business Rule instance
 * and hooks, event handlers and callables) and transition logic (in the form of a Command
 * instance, hooks, event handlers and callables).
 *
 * Transitions can also trigger an exit action for the current state and an
 * entry action for the new state (also via Command instances, event handlers,hooks and
 * callables). This allows you to implement logic that is dependent on the
 * State and independent of the Transition.
 *
 * RULE/COMMAND logic
 * The Rule checks if the domain model (or it's derived data) applies and
 * therefore allows the transition, after which the Command is executed that can
 * actually alter data in the underlying domain models, call services etc.
 * Rules should have NO side effects, since their only function is to check if a 
 * Transition is allowed. Commands do the heavy lifting for executing logic that
 * relates to a transition.
 * 
 * EXCEPTIONS
 * All high level interactions that a client conducts with a statemachine
 * should expect exceptions since runtime exceptions could bubble up from the
 * application specific classes from your domain (eg: calling services, database interactions etc). 
 * Exceptions that bubble up from this statemachine are always izzum\statemachine\Exception types.
 *
 * NAMING CONVENTIONS
 * - A good naming convention for states is to use lowercase-hypen-seperated names:
 * new, waiting-for-input, starting-order-process, enter-cancel-flow, done
 * - A good naming convention for transitions is to bind the input and exit state
 * with the string '_to_', which is done automatically by this package eg: 
 * new_to_waiting-for-input, new_to_done so you're able to call $statemachine->transition('new_to_done');
 * - A good naming convention for events (transition trigger names) is to use
 * lowercase-underscore-seperated names (or singe words) so your able to call
 * $machine->start() or $machine->event_name() or $machine->handle('event_name') 
 * 
 * 
 * MISC
 * The implementation details of this machine make it that it can act both as
 * a mealy machine and as a moore machine. the concepts can be mixed and
 * matched.
