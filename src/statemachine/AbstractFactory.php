/**
 * This class (or it's subclasses) should be the preferred way to get a
 * statemachine.
 * It's based on the AbstractFactory pattern.
 *
 * To fully use polymorphism for all your statemachines, you should instantiate
 * all your machines via factories.
 * Full polymorphism allows you to build tooling that is the same for every
 * statemachine you use in your program. The only thing you would need to do is
 * instantiate the different factories to produce the different machines.
 *
 * The different sql backends provided store a fully qualified factory class
 * name for a machine so you can instantiate factories dynamically.
 *
 *
 * implement the abstract methods in a factory subclass specific to your problem
 * domain.
 *
 * $factory = new MySpecificFactory($dependencies_injected_here);
 * $machine = $factory->getStateMachine($order->getId());
 * $factory->add($machine->getInitialState());
 * $machine->run();

     * TRICKY: When using this method it could lead to unoptimized creation
     * of different builders/loaders/persistence objects.
     * For example: a Loader can be reused, a databaseloader will only have
     * to access a database once for a specific machine to get all the
     * transitions.
     *
     *
     * When using this method when inside a loop of some sorts where multiple
     * statemachines for different entities are needed, it would be wise to
     * cache/reuse the different loaders, builders and persistence adapters.
     *
     * php's spl_object_hash() method would be a good way to cache a fully
     * loaded statemachine.
     *
     * Furthermore, once a Loader, ReferenceBuilder and Adapter for persistence
     * have been instantiated, they can be cached in a field of this class since
     * they can safely be reused and shared. Or just change the context on a
     * machine to have access to all the same transitions, builders etc. of the
     * machine.
