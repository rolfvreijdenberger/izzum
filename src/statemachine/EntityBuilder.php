/**
 * EntityBuilder is an object that builds an entity (an application domain
 * specific model) for a Context object so your statemachine can interact with your
 * domain model.
 * 
 * The entity returned is the application domain specific object that will be
 * injected in the Rules and Commands for a specific statemachine (eg: Order)
 * and can implement event handlers and callables.
 * A typical statemachine would use a subclass of this builder.
 *
 * The Context can build the entity by using the associated Identity object of the
 * Context. the entity can be obtained via the factory method EntityBuilder::getEntity().
 *
 * Of course, a specific Rule or Command can just accept the Identifier directly
 * and use the entity_id to generate the domain object itself. But this would
 * also mean that the Rules and Commands will not be specific to the applications'
 * problem domain but to that of the statemachine (and therefore possibly less
 * reusable). It is therefore advisable to let a builder build your domain model.
 *
 * The Context instance is configured with this builder class by default. It can
 * be configured with a subclass for your application domain if necessary (and the
 * configuration can be done automatically by using a concrete instance of the AbstractFactory)
 *
 * This class implements caching of the domain model/entity returned.
 * The builder is reusable for different statemachines (that have
 * a different Entity by definition). The cache will be rebuilt whenever a new
 * Identifier object is passed to the 'getEntity' method.
 *
 * This specific class (in contrast to subclasses) returns the Identifier itself instead of a domain model. 
 * This is useful because it allows us to test a lot of scenarios without side effects.
 * It also allows us to use the Identifier object for our rules and commands, so
 * you do not necessarily have to write your own entitybuilder.
 *
 * This is a prime candidate to be overriden by subclasses (if need be).
 * Subclass this class and override the 'build' method to return a
 * domain specific object of choice. The building of that domain object depends
 * on the information in the Context, specifically the entity_id.
 *
 * the builder can be configured via dependency injection at creation time so
 * the builder can make use of the injected data when it is called via 'getEntity'.
 *
 * An example of a builder would be an 'EntityBuilderOrder' class,
 * which would be used for a statemachine that uses rules and commands to act
 * upon an 'Order' object from your applation domain.
