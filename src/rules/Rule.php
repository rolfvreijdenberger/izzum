/**
 * Rules are used to encapsulate business rules/logic of the type where you ask
 * a
 * question: 'does this piece of code conform to a specific business rule?'
 *
 * Rules should never have side effects and should only return true or false.
 *
 * This Rule serves as a base class for all your business logic, encapsulating
 * and centralizing the logic in a class and making it reusable through it's
 * interface.
 *
 * This is a way of seperating mechanism and policy of code.
 * In other words: how it is done versus what should be done. The mechanism is a
 * rule
 * library, the policy is what is defined in the rule.
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_mechanism_and_policy
 *
 * The rules package aims to prevent code like this:
 * if ($name == 'blabla' && $password == 'lala') {
 * //do something here. the statement above might be duplicated in a lot of
 * places
 * }
 * and substitute it by this:
 * $rule = new AccesRule($name, $password);
 * if($rule->applies()) {
 * //do something
 * }
 *
 * or:
 * $rule = new IsOrderTaggedForDelivery($order);
 * $rule->applies();
 *
 * usage:
 * Clients should subclass this Rule and implement the
 * protected '_applies' method and let that return a boolean value.
 *
 * A concrete Rule (a subclass) can (and should be) injected with contextual
 * data via
 * dependency injection in the constructor
